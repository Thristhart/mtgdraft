[Conspiracy](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/conspiracy/productinfo) is a very strange Magic The Gathering draft format wherein the cards you draft can impact the draft itself. These cards usually require a change in the draft proceedings that most online drafting tools do not support. The goal of this project is specifically to respond to these cards being drafted appropriately, so that it's possible to play online. As a secondary goal, the project hopes to be a good resource for MTG drafting in general.
